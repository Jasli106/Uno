# Uno
I really hope you know what Uno is--it's a pretty popular game. This is an online version of Uno, which can be played with friends. Currently working on bug fixes and improving the UI!

House rules: you can stack +2 cards, and there are no restrictions on when you can play wild cards.

You can find it [here](https://the-ultimate-uno.herokuapp.com)!

Written with node.js. You can run it locally at http://localhost:2000.
